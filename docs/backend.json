    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to store user profiles, meal logs, and activity logs. Each user has their own dedicated space for their data, ensuring privacy and efficient querying. The structure uses path-based ownership to simplify security rules and ensure data integrity. By structuring data under the `/users/{userId}` path, we achieve strong ownership and avoid the need for complex authorization logic or `get()` calls in security rules. This design enforces Authorization Independence, simplifies debugging, and supports secure `list` operations.\n\nThe `meals`, `activityLogs`, and `plannedMeals` subcollections are designed to store each user's data. This design pattern ensures that each collection has a homogeneous security posture. This structure supports secure and efficient data management for the OyeBhukkaD application."
